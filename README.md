# Backorder Prediction

This project aims to predict product backorders using machine learning.

## Overview of this entire project:
Backorder Prediction is a machine learning project that predicts whether a product will go on backorder (out of stock but still in demand).
Using historical inventory and sales data, the model analyzes factors like lead time, demand, and stock levels to forecast supply chain risks.
The goal is to help businesses optimize inventory management and reduce disruptions. This project utilizes Python, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost for model training and evaluation.
